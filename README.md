PocketMineBanners
=================
Pretty much an easy way to place banners that are about your Minecraft Server. Works for both PC and PE editions of Minecraft. 
=================
I do not own any of the images that are on this page.
If it is your image and you would like me to remove it, just shoot me an email and ask.
=================
To display a banner, clone this repo into a folder on the webroot of a http server that has php and php-gd installed. Then, navigate to the url, eg: 
http://example.com/{folder}/PocketMineBanner.php?ip={serverip}&port={serverport}&servername={servername}&id={idofimage} and that's it. You are able to add more images, just check the source code for an example.
